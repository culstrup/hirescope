### 4. Configure Analysis

- **Number of top candidates**: How many top candidates to identify (5-20)
- **Company context**: Optional description of your company culture

### 5. Review Results

After analysis completes, you'll get:

- **Markdown report**: Comprehensive analysis with all details
- **CSV file**: Top candidates for easy sharing
- **JSON file**: Complete data for further analysis

## Understanding the Output

### Score Ranges

- **90-100**: Exceptional candidates - interview immediately
- **80-89**: Strong candidates - high priority
- **70-79**: Good candidates - worth considering
- **60-69**: Decent matches - review if needed
- **Below 60**: Likely not a strong fit

### Hidden Gems

Pay special attention to the "Hidden Gems" section - these are candidates who:
- Were previously rejected
- Scored 70+ in the AI analysis
- May deserve a second look

In our testing, 20-40% of top candidates were hidden gems!

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Add Company Context**: Improves AI evaluation accuracy
2. **Review All Sections**: Don't just look at scores
3. **Check Data Quality**: AI notes when candidate data is incomplete
4. **Validate Top Picks**: AI is a tool to augment, not replace, human judgment
